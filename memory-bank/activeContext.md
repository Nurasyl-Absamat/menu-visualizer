# Active Context: Menu OCR + Product Matcher

## Current Status
**Phase**: Project Foundation Complete
**Date**: December 2024
**Focus**: Basic MVP structure established and ready for testing

## Current Work
- ✅ Memory Bank structure created
- ✅ Project structure initialized
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration complete
- ✅ Frontend React app with TailwindCSS
- ✅ Backend FastAPI with all services
- ✅ Environment configuration ready

## Completed Components

### Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
- ✅ ImageUploader component with drag/drop
- ✅ ResultsDisplay component with statistics
- ✅ ProductCard component for individual matches
- ✅ LoadingSpinner component
- ✅ Main App component with state management
- ✅ Responsive design with TailwindCSS

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- ✅ Main FastAPI application with all endpoints
- ✅ DatabaseService for MongoDB operations
- ✅ OCRService for GPT-4o Vision integration
- ✅ MatchingService for product catalog matching
- ✅ ImageSearchService for Pexels/Unsplash
- ✅ StorageService for MinIO integration
- ✅ Pydantic schemas for API models

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Docker Compose with all services
- ✅ MongoDB with seeded product catalog
- ✅ MinIO object storage setup
- ✅ Environment configuration templates
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Test the complete system with Docker Compose
2. **API Integration**: Connect frontend to backend APIs
3. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful error handling
4. **Performance**: Test with real menu images

## Key Decisions Made
- Complete MVP structure following PRD specifications
- Memory Bank pattern for comprehensive documentation
- Docker Compose for easy deployment
- Graceful error handling with fallbacks
- Seeded product catalog for immediate testing

## Active Considerations
- **API Keys**: Need real API keys for full functionality
- **Testing**: System needs end-to-end testing
- **Performance**: Image processing may need optimization
- **User Experience**: Frontend needs real backend integration

## Dependencies Ready
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ MongoDB with initial product catalog
- ✅ MinIO bucket setup
- ⏳ API keys for external services (user needs to provide)

## Recent Changes
- Completed all core service implementations
- Created comprehensive Docker setup
- Added detailed README with setup instructions
- Established complete project structure

## Next Session Goals
- Test complete system with `docker-compose up`
- Verify all services start correctly
- Test with sample menu images
- Connect frontend to real backend APIs
- Validate error handling and edge cases
